New git features: 1) graphically view all your branches in a hierarchical fashion based on forking or desired dependencies; 2) cascade recursive rebases down the line

# Status
This is a Work in Progress (WIP). It is NOT yet functional.

# Changelog
- Newest on top
- Follows Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; see: https://semver.org/ for rules & FAQ.
- The 6 most common recommended types of changes are (see here: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/): Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

INITIAL DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
- Use version numbers 0.MINOR.PATCH for the initial development phase; ex: 0.1.0, 0.2.0, etc.
- Usually just increment just the MINOR version number for each new 0.y.z development phase enhancement, until the project is mature enough that you choose to move to a 1.0.0 release.
- You *may* increment the PATCH number for bug fixes to your development code, or just increment the MINOR version number if there are also enhancements.

MORE MATURE PHASE:
- As the project matures, release a 1.0.0 version
- Once you release a 1.0.0 version, do the following (copied from semver.org):
- Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:  
1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,  
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and  
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.  

## [v0.0.0] - 2020-03-22
